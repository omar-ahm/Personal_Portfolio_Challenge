## Project objective
- The challenge is to create a personal portfolio page that you can update throughout the bootcamp with skills and details you learn as you progress through the modules.
## Description

Acceptance criteria:

- When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

- When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications

- When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application

- When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.

## Thought Process

## Initial Wireframe Design

I created my wireframe design using Procreate on Ipad Pro.

I did a mock up of how I wanted to structure the page to give a look and feel of the end result.

Check out my initial layout below

## Resources

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
